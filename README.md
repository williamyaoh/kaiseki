Unintrusive literate programming preprocesor.

### Description

**kaiseki** aims to realize the promises of literate programming: we believe in
writing code for people to read, not for computers to execute.

However, the current crop of literate programming tools have a number of flaws.

Idea shamelessly stolen from [Kartik Agaram](http://akkartik.name/) and his
lovely projects, chief among them being [Mu](https://github.com/akkartik/mu).

More to come.
